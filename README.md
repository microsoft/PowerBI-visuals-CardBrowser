# Card Browser
A quick way to view document contents and metadata

Card Browser is a thumbnail viewer and document reader that features flippable cards, allowing sampling the contents and metadata of a collection of documents or a news stream.  Cards can be expanded into a reader view for examination of a single card's details.

The Preview view unwraps each story into a preview card that reveals the source, headline, and leading text and image of the story. Using the preview view, the reader can scroll through a list or grid of thumbnails to quickly grasp the topic of each story in the collection.  The MetaData view presents the documents' metadata in a tabular format.
